# Lifelong Graph Summarization with Neural Networks



## Downloading the DyLDO dataset

The snapshots from the DyLDO dataset can be downloaded from http://km.aifb.kit.edu/projects/dyldo/data. You can choose a snapshot and download its data.nq.gz. We propose that you put the file in a directory with the date of the snapshot, like 2012-05-06. The directory is used to save all results, models, and measures for the snapshot.


## Executing the code
All code used for the experiments is in the directory 'src'.

## Required Packages

A list of required packages to be imported is provided in the **requirements.txt** file.

## Authors and acknowledgment
We thank  Maximilian Blasi, Manuel Freudenreich, and Johannes Horvath for providing their code to us. 
Their code is the foundation of our code, which we adapted and expanded for our project.
