#Lifelong Graph Summarization with Neural Networks

## Preprocessing:

Execute the code in  **filter** first to filter the downloaded snapshot. <br />
Then, run the code in **summary** to create the summaries and meta-information of the snapshots.   <br />
After that, execute the code in **createSubgraphs** to create the subgraphs later used for validation, training, and testing.

## Measuring:
For the measures, first, execute the code in **measures**. 
Then, run the code in **meta-plots**.

## Validation:
The code for the validation is in **gnn-validation**.

## Training:
The code for the training is in **gnn-training**.

## Testing:
The code for the testing is in **gnn-testing**.

## Evaluataion:
The code for the evaluation is in **evaluation**.
